        <h2>Terms of Use</h2>
        <p class="updated-date">Last updated: June 14, 2025</p>


        <h3>1. Agreement to Terms</h3>
        <p>By creating an account and using our application, Kitchen Navigator (the "Service"), you agree to be bound by these Terms of Use. If you disagree with any part of the terms, then you may not access the Service.</p>

        <h3>2. Accounts</h3>
        <p>When you create an account with us, you must provide information that is accurate, complete, and current at all times. Failure to do so constitutes a breach of the Terms, which may result in immediate termination of your account on our Service.</p>
        <p>You are responsible for safeguarding the password that you use to access the Service and for any activities or actions under your password. You agree not to disclose your password to any third party. You must notify us immediately upon becoming aware of any breach of security or unauthorized use of your account.</p>

        <h3>3. Subscriptions</h3>
        <p>Some parts of the Service are billed on a subscription basis ("Subscription(s)"). You will be billed in advance on a recurring and periodic basis ("Billing Cycle"). Billing cycles are set on a monthly basis.</p>
        <p>At the end of each Billing Cycle, your Subscription will automatically renew under the exact same conditions unless you cancel it or Kitchen Navigator cancels it. You may cancel your Subscription renewal either through your online account management page or by contacting customer support.</p>
        
        <h3>4. Fee Changes</h3>
        <p>Kitchen Navigator, in its sole discretion and at any time, may modify the Subscription fees. Any Subscription fee change will become effective at the end of the then-current Billing Cycle. We will provide you with reasonable prior notice of any change in Subscription fees to give you an opportunity to terminate your Subscription before such change becomes effective.</p>

        <h3>5. Payments and Refunds</h3>
        <p>A valid payment method, including a credit card, is required to process the payment for your Subscription. You shall provide accurate and complete billing information. By submitting such payment information, you automatically authorize Kitchen Navigator to charge all Subscription fees incurred through your account to any such payment instruments.</p>
        <p>Except when required by law, paid Subscription fees are non-refundable.</p>

        <h3>6. User-Generated Content</h3>
        <p>If you create content, such as meal plans or custom recipes, you retain all rights to it, but you grant us a license to use, display, and distribute your content in connection with the Service.</p>
        
        <h3>7. Termination</h3>
        <p>We may terminate or suspend your account immediately, without prior notice or liability, for any reason whatsoever, including without limitation if you breach the Terms.</p>

        <h3>8. Limitation of Liability</h3>
        <p>In no event shall Kitchen Navigator, nor its directors, employees, partners, agents, suppliers, or affiliates, be liable for any indirect, incidental, special, consequential or punitive damages, including without limitation, loss of profits, data, use, goodwill, or other intangible losses, resulting from your access to or use of or inability to access or use the Service.</p>

        <h3>9. Governing Law</h3>
        <p>These Terms shall be governed and construed in accordance with the laws of the province of Ontario, Canada, without regard to its conflict of law provisions.</p>

        <h3>10. Changes to Terms</h3>
        <p>We reserve the right, at our sole discretion, to modify or replace these Terms at any time. We will provide at least 30 days' notice prior to any new terms taking effect. What constitutes a material change will be determined at our sole discretion.</p>
